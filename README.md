# IoT-based-Weather-Reporting-System
This is a simple Smart weather reporting system using Raspberry Pi and suitable sensors.
The system monitors and reports weather parameters such as: Temperature,Humidity,Pressure, and gives alerts whenever it Rains.

In this projects we have used **ThingSpeak** platform for matlab analysis and **IFTTT** service to send alerts and notification.

Components Used in this Project :

1. Raspberry Pi 4B+
2. DH11 Temperature Sensor
3. BMP 180 Barometric Pressure Sensor
4. Rain Sensor
